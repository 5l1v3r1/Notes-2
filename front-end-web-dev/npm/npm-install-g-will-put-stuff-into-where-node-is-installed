# `npm install -g` Will Put Stuff into Where Node is Installed

## Problem
* Want to know the folder that `npm install -g` put the stuff into

## Solution
* Check the path of current npm

      which npm
      // output:
      /usr/local/node/bin/npm

      // You may see $PREFIX=/usr/local/node

* It'll put stuff into `$PREFIX/lib/node_modules` for `npm install -g`
