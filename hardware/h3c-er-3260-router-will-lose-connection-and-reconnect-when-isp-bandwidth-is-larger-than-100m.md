# H3C ER3260 Router Will Lose Connection and Reconnect(PPPOE) when ISP Bandwidth is Larger than 100m

#### Problem
* ISP speeded up the bandwidth from 100m to 200m
* Changed WAN mode to "AUTO" from "100M"
* The router will lose connection and re-connect via PPPOE

#### Solution
* Set WAN mode to "100M" again
